1) This course dealt with a variety of data structure models. Data structures like binary trees, hash tables, link lists along with learning about how to apply this to the appropriate situation.

2)  The way I figured out how to tackle the problem of which data structure to use was first by looking at their strengths and weaknesses then comparing them. Afterwards looking at what assignment or project is in front of me and choosing the data structure that best fit that type of project.

3) Problems I came into were the usual syntax errors and many attempts to write code the correct way and or use the data structures in the right way, I overcame my challenges.

4)  It opened my eyes to the algorithmic approach, it also forced me to broaden my mind when coding and think about using other methods for example like using different data structure methods.

5)  With time and practice all of these types of qualities of a coder do come about. This course has helped me with those elements to make me a better coder for not only future courses but potentially a job in the future.
